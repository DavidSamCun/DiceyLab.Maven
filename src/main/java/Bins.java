/*

idea is to get bins that have an array list of ints. and each int index would increment based on roll

    example
            Bins results = new Bins( 2 the min roll, 12 the max roll)


                    Integer number of tens ====== results.getBin(10) // returns the number of times 10 has been roled
                    results.incrementBin 10  ==== increment bin 10 by 1 if rolled a 10
